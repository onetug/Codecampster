# Orlando Code Camp Code of Conduct

Orlando Code Camp is dedicated to providing an outstanding conference experience for everyone. We hope you find the sessions informative and entertaining, have a chance to connect with your peers and have a day full of learning and meaningful conversations. We expect all attendees, speakers, sponsors, organizers and volunteers at our conference to show respect and courtesy to others at all times. 

Your participation at Orlando Code Camp means you agree to follow the Code of Conduct.

## The TL;DR Version

Orlando Code Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, preferred cloud partner, favorite IDE and tabs - vs - spaces. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in conference talks, workshops, parties, social media and any other Orlando Code Camp venue.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the event and/or a ban on attending future events.

We also prohibit solicitation for non-sponsoring organizations during the conference or a sponsored after-hours gathering by a non-sponsoring party. There are plenty of [sponsorship opportunities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tFwl_kTL8WG904G2Yw0T33K_MfaCzNvS/view) available for the Orlando Code Camp if you or your organization are interested.

## The Full Version

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments, sexual images in public spaces, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention. **Participants asked to stop harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.**

Exhibitors and sponsors in vendor booths and similar activities are also subject to the Code of Conduct policy. Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities or other material. Exhibitors should not wear unprofessional attire.

Attendees must remember that Orlando Code Camp organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they law enforcement. Organizers and volunteers will escalate issues around safety, violence or similar situations to local law enforcement. If there is any doubt as to whether an incident merits reporting, any such incident will be brought to local law enforcement. 

Orlando Code Camp would not be possible without the help and support of the organizers, volunteers and sponsors. Our sponsors pay for exclusive access to event attendees. Any solicitation during the conference or a sponsored after-hours gathering by a non-sponsoring party is prohibited and will result in the immediate removal of the offending party. 

Orlando Code Camp has many sponsorship opportunities available and we welcome and encourage your sponsorship and involvement.

## If There Is A Problem

1. Attendees should show respect and courtesy to others;

2. Individuals are encouraged to resolve simple disagreements;

3. Escalate harassment or more severe issues to event Organizers or Volunteers;

4. Attendees suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact campus security: **407-708-2178** or local law enforcement;

   

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, online or offline, and all conference-related social events.
